FTD2XX_NETclass.cs is a wrapper provided by FTDI.  See:
 \ftdi\FTD2XX_NET_1010

It is a wrapper to allow managed code to use the 'unmanaged' FTDI driver DLL.

From the FTDI Website:
"FTDI have provided a managed .NET wrapper class for the FTD2XX DLL on the Windows platform.  The managed wrapper DLL (FTD2XX_NET.DLL) is provided as a free download with Intellisense documentation provided in the FTD2XX_NET.XML file - this is viewable in the Visual Studio Object Browser and also provides hints as the code is written.  "

Note by JN:
I just use the FTD2XX_NETclass.cs file, not the pre-compiled DLL/XML intellisense file.
